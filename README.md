# CPCS241-HafezahCenterDatabaseProject
In this project, a database is designed for the (Hafezah Women’s Center) of the Khairkom 
Association for memorizing the Holy Quran in Jeddah that aims on publishing the Quranic Ijazah locally 
and globally. 
Hafezah Center organizes its data through Excel sheets. Over time, the center expanded to become the 
largest women’s center specializing in publishing frequent Quranic readings in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia and one of the top ten centers in the world, which led to an increase in the volume of data and the 
difficulty of accessing it, and their need for a database that facilitates search and arrangement and saves 
data from loss
